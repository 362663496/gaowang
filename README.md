# Gaowang Inventory Admin

Self-hosted lightweight inventory admin system.

## Local Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. Set a long `AUTH_SECRET` (at least 32 bytes).
3. For a brand-new database, set `INITIAL_ADMIN_NAME`, `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL`, and `INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (password ≥ 8 chars). Leave them empty if users already exist.
4. Keep `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=false` for plain HTTP local access.
5. Run `make compose-up`.
6. Open `http://localhost:3000` for the web app, or `http://localhost` through Nginx.
7. After the first successful login, remove `INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` from `.env` and recreate/restart the API container.

## Auth And Permissions

- Login uses an HTTP-only cookie session (`gaowang_session`) stored as a hashed token in PostgreSQL. Sessions last 7 days.
- Roles are fixed: `admin` and `staff`. Admin always has every permission.
- Staff start with zero business permissions after upgrade or first deploy. An admin must open **权限管理** and grant access.
- Product delete is an independent permission from create/edit/toggle.
- API and Web must be deployed together; old development `X-Dev-*` headers are ignored.

## Core Commands

- `make api-test`: run Go tests.
- `make api-run`: run Go API locally.
- `make web-install`: install web dependencies after the web app is scaffolded.
- `make web-dev`: run Next.js locally after the web app is scaffolded.
- `make compose-up`: run the stack.
- `make compose-down`: stop the stack.

## Deployment

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set production values, especially `AUTH_SECRET`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, SMTP settings, and `HTTP_PORT`.
2. Confirm the target database already has at least one enabled admin, or provide `INITIAL_ADMIN_*` for an empty database only.
3. Back up the database before upgrade.
4. Set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true` and serve the site over HTTPS. Nginx must forward `X-Forwarded-Proto` (see `deploy/nginx/app.conf`).
5. Deploy API and Web from the same release; staff users will have zero permissions until an admin configures them.
6. Point DNS to the server and run `docker compose up --build -d`.
7. Remove `INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` after the first successful bootstrap.

The Compose stack runs PostgreSQL, the Go API, the Next.js web app, and Nginx. Nginx routes `/api` to the API, `/uploads` to the shared uploads volume, and all other paths to the web app. Product image uploads under `/uploads/*` remain publicly readable.

## Restore

Run from the project root:

```bash
deploy/scripts/restore-db.sh /path/to/gaowang-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.sql.gz
```

The script reads `.env` when present and restores into the running `postgres` Compose service.
